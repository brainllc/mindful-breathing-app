breathwork.fyi next steps (create a .md doc for cursor to see these next steps).

- For each of these items below, let’s start with building the UI first then we will setup supabase and make the backend work. Proceed with these features in the order that you think makes the most sense. I am not technical, so please advise on the most scalable and secure approach to creating all these features. 
- Create a really nice looking navbar that is responsive. We will now need a nav bar that has a link for what is currently the home page, let’s call it Interactive Breathing Exercises, then another one for the lead magnet we will soon be hosting lets call that “Free Breathwork for Stress Guide”. Then another one for the incoming library of courses, let’s call it “Educational Library (Coming Soon)”. Let’s make the educational library link unclickable for the moment.
- Create user registration ui and flow as well as a user profile and settings page. Include everything required for us to be compliant with data and privacy laws. Also, to be safe, let’s restrict users under 18 from accessing our app for now, so let’s weed them out in the user registration flow. 
- Lock some of the breathing exercise (probably half of each of the exercises for each mood category and then those same ones when looking at the All Exercises page) for unregistered users to encourage users to register.
- The cards for the locked exercises should have a CTA on them that says “Create an account for free to unlock” and then a button that says “Create Account”.
- Create progress tracking and dashboard feature. User should have a really nice looking dashboard to show them how many times they have completed each breath work exercise. They should also be able to see how many times they have done breath work exercises over the past 24 hours, past week, past month, and past year.  It should also show them which exercises they do the most and the least.
- Create the page for the “Free Breathwork for Stress Guide”. The idea of this page is to get users to enter their email and sign up for marketing emails. Make it as enticing as possible. For reference, here is some info on the guide. It is called “The 5-Minute Reset: A Science-Backed Guide to Calming Your Nervous System with Breath”. Subtitle is: Your Instant Toolkit for Less Stress, Better Sleep, and Sharper Focus. Here is a blurb on how the guide helps people: Does life ever feel like it's stuck on "fast-forward"?
